                    In today's busy world, life can be hectic. We don't always have time to read everything we would like to. With the sheer volume of media being printed, it can be hard to keep up. Lisingo is trying to help. People want to be able to read webpages (articles, tutorials, etc) on the go, but don't have time. There are also many people in the world with dyslexia whose lives could be improved by this. So we thought it would be a good idea to translate them into downloadale audio files.
